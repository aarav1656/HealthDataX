## Features

### Enhanced Data Privacy Controls

- Users can have fine-grained control over their health data by setting specific permissions for different aspects such as demographics, medical history, genetic information, or specific conditions.
- Robust encryption and anonymization techniques are implemented to protect sensitive information and ensure data privacy.

### Smart Contracts and Tokenization

- Blockchain technology is utilized to establish smart contracts that automate data exchange between individuals and researchers.
- Smart contracts define the terms of data usage, access, and compensation, ensuring transparency and trust in the transaction process.
- A token system is introduced, allowing users to earn tokens for sharing their data, and researchers to use tokens to purchase the data.
- Token transactions are automated through smart contracts, ensuring fair compensation for data contributors.

### Feedback and Ratings System

- Researchers can provide feedback and ratings on the quality and usefulness of the purchased data, which is shared with the data contributors.
- A reputation system is established within the platform, reflecting the reliability and quality of data contributors, incentivizing high-quality and accurate data sharing.

### Incentive Mechanisms

- Reward systems are implemented to motivate users to actively participate in data sharing.
- Bonuses or additional tokens are offered for consistent data contributions or high-quality data, encouraging ongoing engagement and contribution.

### Data Access Marketplace

- Researchers can not only purchase individual's health data but also access aggregated datasets or specific subsets of data collected from multiple contributors.
- The data access marketplace enables researchers to conduct more comprehensive studies and enhances the value proposition of the platform.
